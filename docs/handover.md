- Design tokens: full dark/light theme system with anti-flash script
- Static export to Cloudflare Pages (kkme.eu)

## What's queued

**Superpowers install** (one-off Claude Code session, ~15 min). Prompt at: [docs/phases/superpowers-install-prompt.md](phases/superpowers-install-prompt.md). Runs BEFORE Phase 2B-1 to test Superpowers on a real workload. See ADR-006 and docs/playbooks/tooling.md.

**Backlog triage** (future Cowork session): organize and prioritize backlog.
Prompt at: [docs/phases/backlog-triage-prompt.md](phases/backlog-triage-prompt.md)

## Architecture summary

| Layer | Component | Location |
|-------|-----------|----------|
| Frontend | Next.js 16 static export | `app/` → Cloudflare Pages (kkme.eu) |
| Worker | Cloudflare Worker (7740 lines) | `workers/fetch-s1.js` → kkme-fetch-s1.kastis-kemezys.workers.dev |
| Storage | Cloudflare KV | KKME_SIGNALS namespace |
| VPS | Hetzner 89.167.124.42 | PostgreSQL + scrapers + daily ingestion |
| Mac cron | ~/kkme-cron/ | fetch-btd.js (4h), fetch-vert.js (monthly) — deprecated per /health |
| CI | GitHub Actions | fetch-btd.yml (disabled schedule, manual only) |

Data flow: External APIs → Worker cron / VPS cron → KV → Frontend useSignal hook → Card components.

## External services

- **ENTSO-E** — S1/S4/S8/genload via API key
- **BTD** (api-baltic.transparency-dashboard.eu) — S2 balancing data
- **ECB** (via Frankfurter API) — Euribor, HICP, FX
- **energy-charts.info** — CBET, gas, carbon
- **Anthropic API** — S3 editorial enrichment, Telegram digest
- **Resend** — contact form email
- **Telegram** — daily digest bot
- **Microsoft Clarity** — analytics (vumvn3n1wt)
- **Cloudflare** — Pages hosting, Worker compute, KV storage

## Working protocols

**Session start:** Read this doc → check git state → check production health via `bash scripts/diagnose.sh` → confirm understanding before work.

**Pause-point pattern:** For multi-deliverable sessions, pause after discovery, after build (before deploy), and after verification (before commit). Wait for explicit "proceed."

**Verification:** Curl real endpoints before committing. Screenshot comparison when visual. Build check (`npx tsc --noEmit && npm run build`). Never substitute "I think this works" for "I confirmed this works."

**End of session:** Update this doc's session log + backlog. Commit docs changes.

**Deploy sequence:** `npx tsc --noEmit` → `npm run build` → `npx wrangler deploy` → `bash scripts/validate-deploy.sh` → git commit → git push.

## Tool division

**Cowork** (this tool): planning, reading code, debugging, small-to-medium edits, refactoring, doc maintenance, cross-cutting analysis, prompt authoring, research, strategic thinking.

**Claude Code** (terminal CLI): long feature sessions with multi-file scope, sessions needing chrome-devtools MCP verification, many sequential bash commands, anything risky wanting fresh context. Write prompts to `docs/phases/` and paste into CC.

## Key file locations

See [docs/map.md](map.md) for the full concept-to-file lookup table.

### Backlog notes

**B-001:** Phase 2A-3 Bug 1 fix removed minus sign from worker line ~4725 (`latestFromList`), but frontend still uses inverted convention. The physical truth: LT net_mw=+603 means Lithuania is exporting. NordBalt should show LT→SE, not SE→LT. Files: `lib/baltic-places.ts` (resolveFlow, positiveFlowReceives flag), `HeroBalticMap.tsx` (interconnector list rendering). Fix in Phase 2B-1 which already touches these files.

**B-008:** `lib/safeNum.ts` (2072 bytes) and `app/lib/safeNum.ts` (2072 bytes) — identical size, likely identical content. Same for `useSignal.ts` (2829 bytes each). Need to check imports across the codebase to determine which is imported where, consolidate to one location.

**B-013:** `origin/HEAD` points to `dev` but Cloudflare Pages deploys from `main`. No `dev` branch exists locally (only as remote tracking). Changing default branch in GitHub settings is a no-code operation.

## Session log

### Session 1 — 2026-04-13 — Cowork onboarding + repo organization

**Scope:** Full repository audit, gap analysis, organizational restructure for sustainable Cowork-driven workflow.

**Shipped:**
- Created docs/ subfolder structure: architecture/, playbooks/, principles/, investigations/, phases/, archive/rebuild-specs/
- Moved 13 governance docs from docs/ to docs/principles/ (lowercase-hyphen renamed)
- Moved 15 claude-handover/ files to docs/archive/rebuild-specs/
- Moved 10 investigation reports to docs/investigations/ (date-prefixed)
- Created docs/handover.md (this doc)
- Created docs/map.md (concept-to-file lookup)
- Created docs/glossary.md (energy market terms)
- Created docs/principles/decisions.md (architectural decision log)
- Created 3 playbooks: session-start.md, verification.md, pause-points.md
- Created scripts/diagnose.sh, scripts/verify.sh
- Rewrote CLAUDE.md as 30-line pointer doc
- Updated .gitignore for AI tool dirs, logs, doc binaries
- Created Phase 2B-1 prompt and backlog triage prompt
- Identified and catalogued 14 backlog items (B-001 through B-014)

**Deferred:** PNG/trace file deletion (flagged for manual approval). docs/CHART_AUDIT files not moved (left in docs/ root — see notes).

**Findings:** /genload and /s8 appeared null during audit but confirmed healthy by manual recheck. Arrow direction inversion (B-001) is a real P1 bug visible on production. 462MB of untracked binary files in docs/ need cleanup.

### Session 2 — 2026-04-13 — Tooling evaluation and Superpowers adoption planning

**Scope:** Formalize tool adoption strategy. Evaluate 5 recommended tools against KKME-specific needs. Document decision in ADR-006. Create tooling playbook. Write Superpowers install prompt for a future Claude Code session. Fix the scripts that were created but not committed in Session 1.

**Shipped:**
- ADR-006 in docs/principles/decisions.md (tooling evaluation)
- docs/playbooks/tooling.md (installed tools, rules, usage notes)
- docs/phases/superpowers-install-prompt.md (Claude Code install session)
- scripts/diagnose.sh and scripts/verify.sh added to repo (existed on disk but missed in Session 1 commit)
- handover.md backlog updates (B-015, B-016, B-017)
- handover.md queue update (Superpowers install scheduled before Phase 2B-1)

**Deferred:**
- Actual Superpowers install (requires Claude Code CLI, not Cowork)
- Real-world Superpowers evaluation (happens during Phase 2B-1)

**Findings:** Of 5 tools evaluated (Superpowers, GSD, UI UX Pro Max, Obsidian skill, Awesome Claude Code), only Superpowers passes the net-positive test for KKME. Three rejected on workflow-conflict or wrong-audience grounds. Rejection captured in ADR-006 to prevent re-evaluation churn. Established precedent that every future tool needs an ADR entry before installation — lightweight governance against tool sprawl.

### Session 3 — 2026-04-15 — Phase 2B-1 hero polish (YOLO mode)

**Scope:** Four bundled hero changes, executed end-to-end without pause-point stops (user override). Branch `hero-v3-phase2b-1` off main.

**Shipped:**
- WS1 — Removed permanent project SVG/HTML labels and the connector lines; kept hollow project-dot rings. Hover tooltip was already wired and remains (name · MW · country · COD). Removed `hideCitiesNearProjects` + `findLabelPosition` + `top3` memo + `AVOID_ZONES`. Added `// TODO: Phase 3 mobile tap-to-reveal` marker near the hover targets.
- WS2 — Dropped `items.push('9 SIGNALS LIVE')` from the ticker and replaced the tagline line with `LIVE · ENTSO-E · LITGRID · AST · ELERING`. Grep confirms zero remaining occurrences under app/, lib/, workers/.
- WS3 — Added `--cable-particle` CSS token to both themes in `app/globals.css` (dark: rgb(252,211,77) warm amber; light: rgb(26,26,31) charcoal). Particles in `HeroBalticMap.tsx` now fill via `var(--cable-particle)` at 0.85 opacity, dropping the per-flow rose/teal/neutral tint.
- WS4 — Root-caused arrow inversion: after the Phase 2A-3 worker sign fix, `positiveFlowReceives` in `lib/baltic-places.ts` was still pointing at the exporting country instead of the receiving one. Flipped nordbalt (LT→SE), litpol (LT→PL), estlink-1/-2 (EE→FI). Fenno-Skan left as FI (already correct for SE→FI convention). Single-source fix; no changes to `resolveFlow()` or the render site. Verified against `/s8`: +694 nordbalt now renders `LT → SE 694 MW`, −113 litpol renders `PL → LT 113 MW`, +640 estlink renders `EE → FI`.

**Verification:**
- `npx tsc --noEmit` clean.
- `npm run build` succeeds; production CSS chunk contains both `--cable-particle` values.
- MCP screenshots: dark 1440, light 1440, hover tooltip all captured at `/tmp/phase2b1-*.png`.
- Console: no new errors/warnings (pre-existing THREE.Clock deprecation only).
- `/s8` curl cross-checked against rendered arrows for NordBalt + LitPol — match physical truth.

**Deferred:**
- B-002 (/s8 future timestamp), B-006 (LV↔LT flow display), B-008–B-014 remain open. No new backlog items surfaced during implementation.
- Dev-server Turbopack briefly cached the old CSS after the globals.css edit; verified via `npm run build` + `python3 -m http.server out/` instead. Not a code issue.

**Superpowers:** neutral — session ran in YOLO override with pause points skipped, so Superpowers' brainstorming/plan skills didn't meaningfully engage. The four workstreams were well-specified by the brief, so the frontend-design skill and pause-point playbook were already sufficient. Real evaluation still pending a normal-cadence Phase 2B-2.
